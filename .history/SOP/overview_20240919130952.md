# Vendor Management Web Application - Bare Bones Minimum Version SOP

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the essential steps to create a basic working version of the Vendor Management Web Application using the new tech stack. This document serves as a guide for developers to set up the foundational elements of the application, ensuring a smooth transition from the existing project to the new implementation.

## Setup Steps

1. [x] Set up user authentication with Supabase Auth
2. [x] Initialize Next.js project structure
3. [x] Configure Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components
4. [x] Set up database with Drizzle ORM and Supabase
5. [x] Create basic UI components
6. [ ] Implement core features
7. [ ] Set up API routes

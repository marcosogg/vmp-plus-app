# Vendor Management Web Application - Bare Bones Minimum Version SOP

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the essential steps to create a basic working version of the Vendor Management Web Application using the new tech stack. This document serves as a guide for developers to set up the foundational elements of the application, ensuring a smooth transition from the existing project to the new implementation.

## Setup Steps

1. [x] Set up user authentication with Supabase Auth
2. [x] Initialize Next.js project structure
3. [x] Configure Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components
4. [x] Set up database with Drizzle ORM and Supabase
5. [ ] Create basic UI components
6. [ ] Implement core features
7. [ ] Set up API routes

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Set Up User Authentication with Supabase Auth

- [x] **Create a Supabase Account and Project**
  - Sign up at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) if you haven't already.
  - Create a new project within the Supabase dashboard.
  
- [x] **Configure Supabase Authentication**
  - Navigate to the "Authentication" section in Supabase.
  - Enable desired authentication providers (e.g., email/password, OAuth).
  
- [x] **Integrate Supabase Auth into Next.js**
  - Install the Supabase client library in your Next.js project.
  - Initialize the Supabase client with your project credentials.
  
- [x] **Set Up Authentication Pages**
  - Create login and signup pages within the Next.js app.
  - Design forms for user registration and authentication using Shadcn UI components.
  
- [x] **Implement Clerk Middleware (if applicable)**
  - Configure middleware to protect authenticated routes.
  - Ensure that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application.

### 2. Initialize Next.js Project Structure

- [x] **Initialize the Next.js Project**
  - Use the terminal to create a new Next.js project:
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest vendor-management-rebuilt
    cd vendor-management-rebuilt
    ```
  
- [x] **Set Up the App Directory**
  - Organize the project using Next.js's App Router by structuring pages under the `app` directory.
  
- [x] **Create Layout Files**
  - Develop a root layout that includes global components such as Navbar and Footer.
  - Ensure consistent styling and structure across all pages.
  
- [x] **Configure Routing**
  - Define routes for all main sections of the application (e.g., Vendors, Dashboard, Import, Search).
  - Set up dynamic routing for individual vendor profiles and other entities.

### 3. Configure Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI Components

- [x] **Install Tailwind CSS**
  - Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
  
- [x] **Configure `tailwind.config.js`**
  - Set up the content paths to include all relevant directories:
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
        "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    }
    ```
  
- [x] **Add Tailwind Directives to CSS**
  - In `globals.css`, include the Tailwind directives:
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
  
- [x] **Set Up Shadcn UI Components**
  - Initialize Shadcn UI within the project:
    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui init
    ```
  - Follow the setup prompts to select desired components and themes.
  - Integrate Shadcn components into your React components for consistent UI design.

### 4. Set Up Database with Drizzle ORM and Supabase

- [x] **Configure Drizzle ORM**
  - Install Drizzle ORM and its PostgreSQL adapter:
    ```bash
    npm install drizzle-orm pg
    npm install -D drizzle-kit
    ```
  - Create a configuration file to initialize Drizzle:
    - **File:** `drizzle.config.ts`
    ```typescript
    import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";
    
    export default defineConfig({
      schema: "./db/schema/index.ts",
      out: "./db/migrations",
      driver: "pg",
      dbCredentials: {
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL!
      }
    });
    ```
  
- [x] **Define Database Schema**
  - Create a `db/schema` directory and define schemas for Vendor, Part, Spend, and Risk.
  - **File:** `db/schema/vendor.ts`
  ```typescript
  import { integer, serial, varchar, pgTable } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

  export const vendors = pgTable('vendors', {
    id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
    vendor_name: varchar('vendor_name', { length: 255 }).notNull(),
    vendor_id: varchar('vendor_id', { length: 100 }).unique().notNull(),
    payment_terms: varchar('payment_terms', { length: 100 }),
    country: varchar('country', { length: 100 }),
    average_discount: integer('average_discount'),
    contract_type: varchar('contract_type', { length: 100 }),
    rating: integer('rating'),
    credit_limit: integer('credit_limit'),
    contract_year: integer('contract_year'),
    relationship_type: varchar('relationship_type', { length: 100 }),
  });
  ```
  - Similar schemas have been created for Part, Spend, and Risk.
  
- [x] **Set Up Migrations**
  - Generate migration files based on the schema:
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-kit generate:pg
    ```
  - New migration file created: `db/migrations/0003_first_grey_gargoyle.sql`
  - Apply migrations to the database (to be done):
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-orm migrate
    ```

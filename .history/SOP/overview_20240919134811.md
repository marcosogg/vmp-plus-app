# VMP Plus App - Bare Bones Minimum Version SOP

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps to create a basic working version of the VMP Plus App.

## Setup Steps

1. [x] Set up user authentication with Clerk
2. [x] Initialize Next.js project structure
3. [x] Set up database with Drizzle ORM
4. [x] Create basic UI components
5. [x] Implement core features
6. [x] Set up API routes
7. [x] Secure API routes
8. [x] Implement user-specific authorization

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Set up user authentication with Clerk
- [x] Integrate Clerk for user authentication
- [x] Set up login and signup pages
- [x] Configure Clerk middleware

### 2. Initialize Next.js project structure
- [x] Set up app directory structure
- [x] Create layout files
- [x] Set up routing

### 3. Set up database with Drizzle ORM
- [x] Configure Drizzle ORM
- [x] Create database schema for profiles, notes, and vendors
- [x] Set up database migrations

### 4. Create basic UI components
- [x] Implement Sidebar component
- [x] Create Dashboard component
- [x] Design and implement NoteEditor and NotesList components
- [x] Create VendorForm component for adding and editing vendors

### 5. Implement core features
- [x] Create notes functionality (CRUD operations)
- [x] Implement user profiles
- [x] Implement vendor management
  - [x] Create VendorForm component for adding and editing vendors
  - [x] Implement createVendor and updateVendor actions
  - [x] Add form validation and error handling
  - [x] Implement success/error notifications using toast component

### 6. Set up API routes
- [x] Create API routes for vendor actions (CRUD operations)
- [x] Create API routes for notes actions (CRUD operations)
- [x] Implement API routes for profile actions (CRUD operations)

### 7. Secure API routes
- [x] Implement authentication middleware using Clerk
- [x] Apply authentication middleware to all API routes (vendors, notes, profiles)

### 8. Implement user-specific authorization
- [x] Update auth middleware to pass userId to handler functions
- [x] Modify vendor routes to include user-specific authorization
- [x] Modify notes routes to include user-specific authorization
- [x] Modify profile routes to include user-specific authorization

## Next Steps
We have successfully implemented the basic version of the VMP Plus App. All core features are in place, including user authentication, database setup, UI components, and secure API routes with user-specific authorization. The next steps involve enhancing and optimizing the application:

1. Refine and optimize UI/UX:
   - Improve responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Enhance accessibility features
   - Implement more advanced UI interactions and animations

2. Expand feature set:
   - Add search and filter functionality for vendors, notes, and profiles
   - Implement data visualization for vendor-related metrics
   - Add role-based access control for different user types (e.g., admin, regular user)

3. Performance optimization:
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries and indexes
   - Implement server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) where appropriate

4. Testing and quality assurance:
   - Implement a comprehensive testing strategy (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests)
   - Conduct thorough security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
   - Perform load testing and optimize for scalability

5. Documentation and maintenance:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Document component usage and best practices
   - Set up a system for tracking and resolving bugs and feature requests

6. Deployment and DevOps:
   - Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
   - Configure production-ready environment variables
   - Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting systems

7. Security enhancements:
   - Implement additional security measures (e.g., rate limiting, audit logs)
   - Regularly update dependencies and address any security vulnerabilities

8. Scalability preparations:
   - Design and implement a strategy for handling increased load
   - Consider microservices architecture for specific features if needed

By continuing to iterate on these aspects, we will create a robust, secure, and scalable Vendor Management Web Application that meets the evolving needs of our users and adheres to best practices in modern web development.

Remember to regularly review and update this SOP as the project evolves and new requirements emerge.

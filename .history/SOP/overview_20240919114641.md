# Vendor Management Web Application - Bare Bones Minimum Version SOP

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the essential steps to create a basic working version of the Vendor Management Web Application using the new tech stack. This document serves as a guide for developers to set up the foundational elements of the application, ensuring a smooth transition from the existing project to the new implementation.

## Setup Steps

1. [x] Set up user authentication with Supabase Auth
2. [x] Initialize Next.js project structure
3. [x] Configure Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components
4. [ ] Set up database with Drizzle ORM and Supabase
5. [ ] Create basic UI components
6. [ ] Implement core features
7. [ ] Set up API routes

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Set Up User Authentication with Supabase Auth

- [x] **Create a Supabase Account and Project**
  - Sign up at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) if you haven't already.
  - Create a new project within the Supabase dashboard.
  
- [ ] **Configure Supabase Authentication**
  - Navigate to the "Authentication" section in Supabase.
  - Enable desired authentication providers (e.g., email/password, OAuth).
  
- [ ] **Integrate Supabase Auth into Next.js**
  - Install the Supabase client library in your Next.js project.
  - Initialize the Supabase client with your project credentials.
  
- [ ] **Set Up Authentication Pages**
  - Create login and signup pages within the Next.js app.
  - Design forms for user registration and authentication using Shadcn UI components.
  
- [ ] **Implement Clerk Middleware (if applicable)**
  - Configure middleware to protect authenticated routes.
  - Ensure that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application.

### 2. Initialize Next.js Project Structure

- [ ] **Initialize the Next.js Project**
  - Use the terminal to create a new Next.js project:
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest vendor-management-rebuilt
    cd vendor-management-rebuilt
    ```
  
- [ ] **Set Up the App Directory**
  - Organize the project using Next.js's App Router by structuring pages under the `app` directory.
  
- [ ] **Create Layout Files**
  - Develop a root layout that includes global components such as Navbar and Footer.
  - Ensure consistent styling and structure across all pages.
  
- [ ] **Configure Routing**
  - Define routes for all main sections of the application (e.g., Vendors, Dashboard, Import, Search).
  - Set up dynamic routing for individual vendor profiles and other entities.

### 3. Configure Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI Components

- [ ] **Install Tailwind CSS**
  - Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
  
- [ ] **Configure `tailwind.config.js`**
  - Set up the content paths to include all relevant directories:
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      content: [
        "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
        "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
      ],
      theme: {
        extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
    }
    ```
  
- [ ] **Add Tailwind Directives to CSS**
  - In `globals.css`, include the Tailwind directives:
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
  
- [ ] **Set Up Shadcn UI Components**
  - Initialize Shadcn UI within the project:
    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui init
    ```
  - Follow the setup prompts to select desired components and themes.
  - Integrate Shadcn components into your React components for consistent UI design.

### 4. Set Up Database with Drizzle ORM and Supabase

- [ ] **Configure Drizzle ORM**
  - Install Drizzle ORM and its Supabase integration:
    ```bash
    npm install drizzle-orm drizzle-orm-supabase
    ```
  - Create a configuration file to initialize Drizzle with Supabase:
    - **File:** `lib/drizzleConfig.js`
    ```javascript
    import { createClient } from 'drizzle-orm-supabase'

    const drizzle = createClient({
      url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
      key: process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY,
    })

    export default drizzle
    ```
  
- [ ] **Define Database Schema**
  - Create a `models` directory and define models corresponding to the original Django models (Vendor, Part, Spend, Risk, Activity).
  
- [ ] **Set Up Migrations**
  - Initialize migration setup with Drizzle ORM:
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-orm migrate:init
    ```
  - Create initial migration files to set up the database schema.
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-orm migrate:create initial_setup
    ```
  - Apply migrations to Supabase:
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-orm migrate:up
    ```

### 5. Create Basic UI Components

- [ ] **Develop Common Components**
  - **Button Component:** Reusable button with consistent styling.
  - **Modal Component:** For dialogs and user prompts.
  - **Table Component:** To display tabular data.
  - **FormInput Component:** Standardized input fields with validation.
  
- [ ] **Build Layout Components**
  - **Navbar:** Top navigation bar with links to main sections.
  - **Footer:** Footer with relevant links and information.
  - **Sidebar:** Optional sidebar for additional navigation or settings.
  
- [ ] **Create Feature-Specific Components**
  - **VendorList:** Displays a list of vendors with sorting and filtering options.
  - **VendorCard:** Individual vendor details in a card format.
  - **VendorForm:** Form for creating and updating vendor information.
  - **PartList & PartCard:** Similar components for managing parts.
  - **SpendList & SpendCard:** Components for handling spend records.
  - **RiskAssessment:** Displays risk scores and related information.
  - **ActivityLog:** Shows user activities within the application.

### 6. Implement Core Features

- [ ] **Vendor Management**
  - **CRUD Operations:** Enable creating, reading, updating, and deleting vendor records.
  - **Search Functionality:** Implement global search across vendors, parts, and spends.
  
- [ ] **Parts Management**
  - **CRUD Operations:** Manage parts associated with vendors.
  
- [ ] **Spend Records**
  - **CRUD Operations:** Handle spend data related to vendors.
  
- [ ] **Risk Assessments**
  - **Risk Scoring:** Implement calculations for risk levels and scores.
  
- [ ] **Activity Tracking**
  - **User Activities:** Record and display user actions within the app.
  
- [ ] **User Profiles**
  - **Profile Management:** Allow users to view and edit their profiles.

### 7. Set Up API Routes

- [ ] **Create API Routes for Core Entities**
  - **Vendors API:** Routes for handling vendor-related actions.
  - **Parts API:** Routes for managing parts data.
  - **Spends API:** Routes for spend records operations.
  - **Risk API:** Routes for risk assessment functionalities.
  - **Activities API:** Routes for logging and retrieving user activities.
  
- [ ] **Implement Server Actions**

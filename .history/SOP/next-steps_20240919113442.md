# VMP Plus App - Next Steps

This document provides detailed instructions for the remaining steps to complete the basic working version of the VMP Plus App.

## 2. Initialize Next.js project structure

### Set up app directory structure
1. Create the following directories in the `app` folder if they don't already exist:
   - `(auth)`
   - `(marketing)`
   - `api`
   - `notes`
2. Ensure that the existing files are in their correct locations within these directories.

### Create layout files
1. In the root of the `app` folder, create or update `layout.tsx` to define the main layout for the application.
2. Create `(auth)/layout.tsx` for authentication-related pages.
3. Create `(marketing)/layout.tsx` for marketing-related pages.

### Set up routing
1. Create or update the following files:
   - `app/page.tsx` (main page)
   - `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` (marketing landing page)
   - `app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx` (pricing page)
   - `app/notes/page.tsx` (notes list page)
   - `app/notes/[id]/page.tsx` (individual note page)
2. Implement basic routing logic in these files using Next.js 13+ routing conventions.

## 3. Set up database with Drizzle ORM

### Configure Drizzle ORM
1. Install Drizzle ORM and its dependencies:
   ```
   npm install drizzle-orm pg
   npm install -D drizzle-kit
   ```
2. Create a `db` folder in the project root if it doesn't exist.
3. In the `db` folder, create `db.ts` to set up the database connection using Drizzle.

### Create database schema for profiles and notes
1. In the `db/schema` folder, create or update the following files:
   - `profiles-schema.ts`
   - `notes-schema.ts`
2. Define the schema for profiles and notes using Drizzle's schema definition syntax.

### Set up database migrations
1. Create a `drizzle.config.ts` file in the project root to configure Drizzle Kit.
2. Run the following command to generate migrations:
   ```
   npx drizzle-kit generate:pg
   ```
3. Review the generated migrations in the `db/migrations` folder.
4. Apply the migrations to your database:
   ```
   npx drizzle-kit push:pg
   ```

## 4. Create basic UI components

### Implement Sidebar component
1. Create `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`.
2. Implement a basic sidebar with navigation links to different sections of the app.

### Create Dashboard component
1. Create `components/Dashboard.tsx`.
2. Design a dashboard layout that will display user-specific information and quick access to main features.

### Design and implement NoteEditor and NotesList components
1. Create `components/notes/NoteEditor.tsx`.
2. Implement a form for creating and editing notes.
3. Create `components/notes/NotesList.tsx`.
4. Implement a list view for displaying user's notes with options to edit and delete.

## 5. Implement core features

### Create notes functionality (CRUD operations)
1. In `actions/notes-actions.ts`, implement functions for:
   - Creating a new note
   - Reading a note
   - Updating an existing note
   - Deleting a note
2. Ensure these functions interact with the database using Drizzle ORM.

### Implement user profiles
1. In `actions/profiles-actions.ts`, implement functions for:
   - Creating a user profile
   - Reading a user profile
   - Updating a user profile
2. Integrate profile management with the Clerk authentication system.

## 6. Set up API routes

### Create API routes for notes actions
1. In the `app/api` directory, create a `notes` folder.
2. Implement the following API routes:
   - `POST /api/notes` (create note)
   - `GET /api/notes` (get all notes)
   - `GET /api/notes/[id]` (get single note)
   - `PUT /api/notes/[id]` (update note)
   - `DELETE /api/notes/[id]` (delete note)

### Implement API routes for profile actions
1. In the `app/api` directory, create a `profiles` folder.
2. Implement the following API routes:
   - `POST /api/profiles` (create profile)
   - `GET /api/profiles/[id]` (get profile)
   - `PUT /api/profiles/[id]` (update profile)

Remember to test each component and feature as you implement them. Once all these steps are completed, you should have a basic working version of the VMP Plus App.

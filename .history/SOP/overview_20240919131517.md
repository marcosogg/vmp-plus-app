# VMP Plus App - Bare Bones Minimum Version SOP

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps to create a basic working version of the VMP Plus App.

## Setup Steps

1. [x] Set up user authentication with Clerk
2. [ ] Initialize Next.js project structure
3. [ ] Set up database with Drizzle ORM
4. [ ] Create basic UI components
5. [ ] Implement core features
6. [ ] Set up API routes

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Set up user authentication with Clerk
- [x] Integrate Clerk for user authentication
- [x] Set up login and signup pages
- [x] Configure Clerk middleware

### 2. Initialize Next.js project structure
- [ ] Set up app directory structure
- [ ] Create layout files
- [ ] Set up routing

### 3. Set up database with Drizzle ORM
- [ ] Configure Drizzle ORM
- [ ] Create database schema for profiles, notes, and vendors
- [ ] Set up database migrations

### 4. Create basic UI components
- [ ] Implement Sidebar component
- [ ] Create Dashboard component
- [ ] Design and implement NoteEditor and NotesList components
- [x] Create VendorForm component for adding and editing vendors

### 5. Implement core features

- [x] Set up API routes for vendor actions (create and update)

## Next Steps
After completing these basic steps, you will have a working version of the VMP Plus App with core functionality, including user authentication, note management, and vendor management. Further improvements, testing, and deployment can be addressed in future iterations.

### Future Enhancements
- Implement VendorList component to display and manage existing vendors
- Add search and filter functionality for vendors
- Implement additional vendor-related features (e.g., vendor performance tracking, contract management)
- Enhance UI/UX with more sophisticated designs and interactions
- Implement data visualization for vendor-related metrics
- Add role-based access control for different user types (e.g., admin, regular user)
- Implement a comprehensive testing strategy (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests)
- Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- Optimize performance and implement caching strategies
- Enhance security measures (e.g., input sanitization, rate limiting, audit logs)

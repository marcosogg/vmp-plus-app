# VMP Plus App - Bare Bones Minimum Version SOP

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps to create a basic working version of the VMP Plus App.

## Setup Steps

1. [x] Set up user authentication with Clerk
2. [ ] Initialize Next.js project structure
3. [ ] Set up database with Drizzle ORM
4. [ ] Create basic UI components
5. [ ] Implement core features
6. [x] Set up API routes
7. [x] Secure API routes

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Set up user authentication with Clerk
- [x] Integrate Clerk for user authentication
- [x] Set up login and signup pages
- [x] Configure Clerk middleware

### 2. Initialize Next.js project structure
- [ ] Set up app directory structure
- [ ] Create layout files
- [ ] Set up routing

### 3. Set up database with Drizzle ORM
- [ ] Configure Drizzle ORM
- [ ] Create database schema for profiles, notes, and vendors
- [ ] Set up database migrations

### 4. Create basic UI components
- [ ] Implement Sidebar component
- [ ] Create Dashboard component
- [ ] Design and implement NoteEditor and NotesList components
- [x] Create VendorForm component for adding and editing vendors

### 5. Implement core features
- [ ] Create notes functionality (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Implement user profiles
- [x] Implement vendor management
  - [x] Create VendorForm component for adding and editing vendors
  - [x] Implement createVendor and updateVendor actions
  - [x] Add form validation and error handling
  - [x] Implement success/error notifications using toast component

### 6. Set up API routes
- [x] Create API routes for vendor actions (CRUD operations)
- [x] Create API routes for notes actions (CRUD operations)
- [x] Implement API routes for profile actions (CRUD operations)

### 7. Secure API routes
- [x] Implement authentication middleware using Clerk
- [x] Apply authentication middleware to all API routes (vendors, notes, profiles)

## Next Steps
We have successfully implemented and secured Traditional API Routes for all core entities (vendors, notes, and profiles). This architectural decision enhances the application's scalability, maintainability, and security by clearly separating frontend and backend logic and ensuring that only authenticated users can access the API. The next steps involve:

1. Enhancing API route security:
   - Implement authorization logic to ensure users can only access their own data
   - Add input validation and sanitization for all API routes
   - Set up rate limiting to prevent abuse

2. Updating frontend components:
   - Modify existing components to use the new API routes
   - Implement error handling and loading states in the UI
   - Ensure proper handling of authentication states in the frontend

3. Testing API routes:
   - Write unit tests for each API route
   - Perform integration testing to ensure proper interaction between frontend and backend
   - Conduct security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments

4. Documentation:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation, including request/response formats and authentication requirements
   - Update component documentation to reflect the use of API routes and authentication

5. Performance optimization:
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries and indexes

6. Deployment preparation:
   - Set up environment variables for different deployment environments
   - Configure CORS settings for production
   - Ensure proper error logging and monitoring in production

### Future Enhancements
- Implement VendorList component to display and manage existing vendors
- Add search and filter functionality for vendors
- Implement additional vendor-related features (e.g., vendor performance tracking, contract management)
- Enhance UI/UX with more sophisticated designs and interactions
- Implement data visualization for vendor-related metrics
- Add role-based access control for different user types (e.g., admin, regular user)
- Implement a comprehensive testing strategy (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests)
- Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- Optimize performance and implement caching strategies
- Enhance security measures (e.g., input sanitization, rate limiting, audit logs)

By following these steps and continuously iterating on the application, we will create a robust, secure, and scalable Vendor Management Web Application that meets the needs of our users and adheres to best practices in modern web development.

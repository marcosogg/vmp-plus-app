# VMP Plus App - Bare Bones Minimum Version SOP

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps to create a basic working version of the VMP Plus App.

## Setup Steps

1. [x] Set up user authentication with Clerk
2. [ ] Initialize Next.js project structure
3. [ ] Set up database with Drizzle ORM
4. [ ] Create basic UI components
5. [ ] Implement core features
6. [x] Set up API routes

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Set up user authentication with Clerk
- [x] Integrate Clerk for user authentication
- [x] Set up login and signup pages
- [x] Configure Clerk middleware

### 2. Initialize Next.js project structure
- [ ] Set up app directory structure
- [ ] Create layout files
- [ ] Set up routing

### 3. Set up database with Drizzle ORM
- [ ] Configure Drizzle ORM
- [ ] Create database schema for profiles, notes, and vendors
- [ ] Set up database migrations

### 4. Create basic UI components
- [ ] Implement Sidebar component
- [ ] Create Dashboard component
- [ ] Design and implement NoteEditor and NotesList components
- [x] Create VendorForm component for adding and editing vendors

### 5. Implement core features
- [ ] Create notes functionality (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Implement user profiles
- [x] Implement vendor management
  - [x] Create VendorForm component for adding and editing vendors
  - [x] Implement createVendor and updateVendor actions
  - [x] Add form validation and error handling
  - [x] Implement success/error notifications using toast component

### 6. Set up API routes
- [x] Create API routes for vendor actions (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Create API routes for notes actions
- [ ] Implement API routes for profile actions

## Next Steps
After completing these basic steps, you will have a working version of the VMP Plus App with core functionality, including user authentication, note management, and vendor management. Further improvements, testing, and deployment can be addressed in future iterations.

### Traditional API Routes Implementation
We have successfully implemented Traditional API Routes for the vendor entity. This architectural decision enhances the application's scalability and maintainability by clearly separating frontend and backend logic. The next steps involve:

1. Completing the API routes for the remaining core entities (notes and profiles).
2. Ensuring all API routes are secure and properly documented.
3. Updating the frontend components to use these new API routes.
4. Conducting thorough testing to ensure functionality and security of all API routes.

### Future Enhancements
- Implement VendorList component to display and manage existing vendors
- Add search and filter functionality for vendors
- Implement additional vendor-related features (e.g., vendor performance tracking, contract management)
- Enhance UI/UX with more sophisticated designs and interactions
- Implement data visualization for vendor-related metrics
- Add role-based access control for different user types (e.g., admin, regular user)
- Implement a comprehensive testing strategy (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests)
- Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- Optimize performance and implement caching strategies
- Enhance security measures (e.g., input sanitization, rate limiting, audit logs)
